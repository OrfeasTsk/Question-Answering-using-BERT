# Question-Answering-using-BERT
In this project the goal is to fine tune BERT models in popular QA datasets (SQuAD 2.0, TriviaQA, NQ, QuAC, NewsQA)


# Project subtasks 
1) In this and the following question you will develop a model for question answering on
the dataset SQuAD 2.0. Start by visiting the Web site https://rajpurkar.github.io/
SQuAD-explorer/, understanding the dataset and reading the relevant paper available.
Your job is to fine-tune BERT-base for this task

2) In this question you will read the paper "What do Models Learn from Question Answering
Datasets?" and you will reproduce some of the results of that paper. In particular, you
have to reproduce the results of Table 3.
